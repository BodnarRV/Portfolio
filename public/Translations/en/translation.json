    "aboutMeText": " Hello, my name is Rostyslav!<br><br><br> In 2019, I began my journey at Dewlight as a Swift trainee. Following my training, I successfully interviewed for a Junior iOS Developer position and started working on the company's project, Devlight ERM. This application, designed for company employees, provides information about the company, vacation tracking, project histories, company news, and more. I was the sole developer on this project.<br><br>  Concurrently, my friends and I initiated a startup project called Malo, an app for restaurants. This app allows users to place orders, make payments, leave feedback for restaurants and staff, and track their favorite places and foods. My primary contribution to this project was creating the user interface.<br><br>  After my time at Dewlight, I joined SoftServe and worked there for 2 years on a project in the healthcare domain. My responsibilities included providing new features, fixing bugs, and occasionally refactoring code.",
